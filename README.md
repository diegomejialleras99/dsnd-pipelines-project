# Fashion Trend Prediction

This project contains a Jupyter notebook (`starter.ipynb`) that implements a data science pipeline to predict whether a customer would recommend a product or not. This model will analyze the text of a review, the customer's age, the product category, and other relevant information to predict whether the customer would recommend the product or not. 

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/diegomejialleras99/dsnd-pipelines-project.git

cd dsnd-pipelines-project

### Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Installation

Step-by-step explanation of how to get a development environment running.

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   Download the project files to your local machine using Git:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-events-classifier.git
   cd employee-events-classifier
   
3. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment**
   
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts:
   
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows

4. **Install dependencies**
   
   Use the requirements.txt file to install all necessary libraries:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Execute the notebook**
   
  Run each cell sequentially to:

  Load and explore the dataset
  
  Train the model
  
  Evaluate results

## Project Instructions

The project is implemented in a single notebook starter.ipynb and includes the following student deliverables:

Load and explore the employee dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Preprocess data (e.g., encode categorical variables, normalize).
Train a classifier to predict the event label.
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
Interpret the model results, including feature importance.
